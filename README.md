# GeoLocator
The goal is to code a simple web app which allows multiple users to share their locations. The web technologies to use are JavaScript, JQuery, and Knockout.
Stage 1: Basic Web UI functionality for getting users’ location

Tasks & objectives:
- A web page where users can type their user name.
- The web page should be able to get a user’s GPS location.
- It should support major browsers in iOS, Android, and Windows.
- Use Knockout & JQuery Mobile (see the references).

Stage 2: Display user’s location on Baidu map
Tasks & objectives:
- The web server should have the users’ recent locations after stage 1.
- The web page should show all users’ user names & their locations in Baidu map in stage 1.
- Additional UI requirements: assign each user a different color, which will make it better to show
in the map. It should also show the timestamp of when a user last sends his/her location.
